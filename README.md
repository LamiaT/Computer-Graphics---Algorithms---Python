# Computer-Graphics---Algorithms---Python

Computer Graphics Algorithms programmed in Python by me during semester break.

This is my hard attempt to implement these algorithms as accurately as possible in Python.

Here, Computer Graphics Algorithms includes:
    
    1. DDA Algorithm
    2. Midpoint Line 8 Way Symmetry Algorithm
    3. Midpoint Circle Algorithm
    4. Clipping Algorithm - Cyrus Beck
    5. Clipping Algorithm - Cohen Sutherland
    6. 2-Dimensional Transformations Algorithms
